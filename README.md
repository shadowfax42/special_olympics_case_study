# The Special Olympics case study
This course project is inspired by how SAS Analytics was used in the Special Olympics world games in UAE in 2019. To ensure the safety of all the participating athletes while keeping the
fans attending the games engaged. The report will explain my personal analytics approach to address the athletes’ safety and the fans’ engagement.
